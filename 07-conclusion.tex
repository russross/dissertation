\chapter{Conclusion}\label{cha:conclusion}

This dissertation concludes with a discussion of opportunities for future research and a summary of the work presented here.

\section{Future Work}

Storage clusters are only partially specified in this work, and much additional research is necessary to make them a reality. Even the storage component that is the focus of this dissertation is only partially specified. Also, some parts of the existing design point to areas for future work. A few of these areas are addressed in this section.

\subsection{Storage layer}

The prototype implementation of Envoy relies on a simplistic storage layer that is statically allocated and managed. Much of the work discussed in \secref{sec:storage-layer-systems} could be applied to create a robust and performant storage service. 

\subsection{Envoy}

\subsection{Read-only leases}
\subsection{Custom protocol}
Cache at client for unshared objects, at envoy for shared
\subsection{Storage-informed load balancing}
\subsection{Recovery}

\section{Summary}
