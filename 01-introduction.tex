\section{Service clusters}

\subsection{Computation as a commodity}
\subsection{Services as a management unit}
\subsection{Need for another storage system}

\section{Contributions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Argument for commodity computing needing a platform
\item Argument for services as basic unit of management
\item Argument for clusters of services as platform for commodity computing
\item Argument for new storage system to meet needs of this platform
\item Design of Envoy file system
\item Prototype and evaluation of Envoy
\end{itemize}

\section{Outline of dissertation}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Background: commodity computing (GRID, clusters, utility computing), virtual machines, file systems
\item Motivation: state of commodity computing, argument for service-based economy, proposal and definition of service clusters
\item Design: Needs of storage clusters, high-level design of Envoy, management and how it appears to users, storage layer, envoy layer, tricky features and operations
\item Prototype implementation
\item Evaluation
\item Conclusion
\end{enumerate}
