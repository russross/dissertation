\chapter{Introduction}

This dissertation presents the design and implementation of a distributed file system. The design is motivated by the requirements of a new environment that emerges at the intersection of two trends: the renaissance of machine virtualization as a tool for hardware management, and the increasing use of commodity hardware and software for problems at the high end of the computation spectrum. 

\section{Motivation}

* Trends: commodity hardware 
* Storage for specific environments
* Storage driven by practical realities
* Competing goals: speed vs reliability, etc.
* POSIX is limited: extend with snapshots, forks, etc.
* VMs

\section{Contributions}

* Argument for commodity computing needing a platform
* Argument for services as basic unit of management
* Argument for clusters of services as platform for commodity computing
* Argument for new storage system to meet needs of this platform
* Design of Envoy file system
* Prototype and evaluation of Envoy

\section{Outline}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Background: commodity computing (GRID, clusters, utility computing), virtual machines, file systems
\item Motivation: state of commodity computing, argument for service-based economy, proposal and definition of service clusters
\item Design: Needs of storage clusters, high-level design of Envoy, management and how it appears to users, storage layer, envoy layer, tricky features and operations
\item Prototype implementation
\item Evaluation
\item Conclusion
\end{enumerate}
