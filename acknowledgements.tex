\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

My advisor, Ian Pratt, helped in countless ways to set the course of my research and see it through, demanding rigour and offering many helpful suggestions. Major inflection points in my work always seemed to follow meetings with him. Steve Hand also helped me throughout my time at Cambridge, offering sound advice when needed and sharing his mastery of the research game. Jon Crowcroft read drafts of my dissertations, even taking time from his Christmas holiday to send me feedback.

I was fortunate to be in the Systems Research Group during a time when it was full of clever and interesting people doing good research. Andy Warfield, Alex Ho, Eva Kalyvianaki, Christian Kreibich, and Anil Madhavapeddy have been particularly rich sources of conversation and camaraderie.

I might not have survived the whole experience without Nancy, whose love and constant support provided a foundation for everything else.
